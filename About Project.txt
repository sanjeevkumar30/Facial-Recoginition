Introduction:

This project is of Machine Learning Face Recoginision project 
In this project i have used
1. OpenCV a common and mostly used library of python.
2. Numpy 

This project is divided into three parts:
1. part1.py
In this a dialoge box will open and take the samples of your faces (Here I have set the samples to 100 so that my collection dosen't fill.)

2.part2.py
In this our model will train.
It converts all the images to gray scale(black and white type, which helps it to train our model better)

3. part3.py
This will take final picture of user and the compare with the trained model. And give the final output.
